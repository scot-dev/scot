# The data set contains a continuous 45 channel EEG recording of a motor
# imagery experiment. The data was preprocessed to reduce eye movement
# artifacts and resampled to a sampling rate of 100 Hz. With a visual cue, the
# subject was instructed to perform either hand or foot motor imagery. The
# trigger time points of the cues are stored in 'triggers', and 'classes'
# contains the class labels. Duration of the motor imagery period was
# approximately six seconds.
