# The example data set contains a continuous 45 channel EEG recording of a motor
# imagery experiment. The data was preprocessed to reduce eye movement artifacts
# and resampled to a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
# With a visual cue the subject was instructed to perform either hand of foot
# motor imagery. The the trigger time points of the cues are stored in 'tr', and
# 'cl' contains the class labels (hand: 1, foot: -1). Duration of the motor
# imagery period was approximately 6 seconds.
